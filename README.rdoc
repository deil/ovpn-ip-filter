= OpenVPN IP Filter

Simple and small script (client-connect) to restrict incoming connections from specific IP addresses only. All illegal connections to OpenVPN server are rejected.

== ovpn-ip-filter.txt
This file contains information about client Common Names and allowed IP ranges.

Format:
cn ip_address/netmask

E.g. to restrict connections for client test_cn to 91.233.244.1 only, the file should contain:
test_cn 91.233.244.1/32

If you want to allow whole subnet 91.233.244.1-91.233.244.255 (for clients with dynmic IP), you should write:
test_cn 91.233.244.1/24
